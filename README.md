# SQLServer_VENV
Simulating on-prem virtualization and database best practices for managing Dev, Staging, and Prod environments.

## Business Case
A holding company provides centralized IT, HR, finance services to a dozen subsidiary trading and distribution companies. Their infrastructure is currently based on on-prem DB2 databases. They are moving to the cloud.

## Approach
Small-scale simulation managed by a team of 1 member combines system administration (virtualization, Infrastructure-as-Code) and database administration (database) in one repo.

## Documentation
- This README.md file provides an overview of the project, its structure, and how to set up the environments.
- The `docs` directory contains detailed documentation on the project, including setup instructions, best practices, and troubleshooting tips.
- The [wiki](https://github.com/vespertron/SQLServer_VENV/wiki) is used for collaborative documentation and knowledge sharing.
- System and Database Administration tasks are logged on [this Trello board](https://trello.com/b/RnV4u78D/sql-server-system-database-administration).

## Features

- **Virtualization**: Using VirtualBox to create and manage virtual machines for Dev, Staging, and Prod environments.
- **Database Management**: SQL Server databases are set up in each environment with best practices for performance and security.
